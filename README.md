# Peace among worlds

I'm just a bored nerd that develop some boring things, most of my codes are at [github.com](https://github.com/BRonen).

Actually addicted to chess (800 rating yet but rising): [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/BRonen_NaN)


Trying to improve my *C language* and *Data Structures*, maybe will improve *Javascript* (mainly *Typescript*) later but playing with *Wordpress* and *PHP* sometimes too.
Already know the basic of:
 - front-end with **React.js**;
 - back-end with **Node.js** + **MongoDB**;

but nothing really great I guess.


Already with a favorite language, ***falling in [LÃ¶ve](https://www.love2d.org/) with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)*** ~~(the joke is better in portuguese huehuebr)~~...

Always ready to help who are learning, just send something on my discord: ***@BRonen#7226***

Thanks for coming and if you want something else try my discord or my email: **brennopereira6@gmail.com**
